# My-College-Student-Calculator
  This is a software application built in completion of the "Build a Financial Hack" daily challenge for MLH INIT 2022 with the Python programming language. This software application allows students to input their weekly income on their credit card in conjunction with the amount of money they intend to keep on hand. They then determine the weekly expense of each particular type of expense. At then end of the program, the software then conveys to the user how much money they have leftover for other expenses on both their credit card as well as the amount of money they have on hand.
